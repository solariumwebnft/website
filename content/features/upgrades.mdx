In the game, each module can be upgraded up to 6 times, with every upgrade introducing new sub-modules or enhancing existing functionalities. Upgrades are essential for maximizing the efficiency of your mining operations and strengthening your defenses.

### Upgrade Details

- **Upgrade Structure:**  
  Each module consists of 6 sub-modules, with specifications that are randomly generated. These specs vary between minimum and maximum values, adding a unique aspect to each upgrade.

- **Energy Pool Dependency:**  
  The mining power of each land is determined by its module configuration. The planet itself acts as a mining pool with a fixed **KHS** (kilo hash per second) value, which influences the overall mining capacity.

- **Halving and Renewal:**  
  When a planet reaches its maximum **KHS** value, a **halving event** occurs. This event halts the addition of new lands to that planet. To proceed, players must **renew** their modules using anomalous materials sourced from other planets.

- **Investment and Returns:**  
  The cost of renewal is based on the current token value, reflecting 80% of the user’s initial investment. Upgrades affect returns in the following ways:

  - The return rate for each module starts at **0.3% per day**, with a **0.01% spread** for every additional module.
  - The return from each upgrade is distributed over **30%** of the upgrade's value per hour, ensuring a consistent flow of rewards.

- **Resource Interdependence:**  
  Planets within the game are interdependent. For example, the red planet may rely on resources from the yellow planet, creating a strategic network where resource management and trade are crucial.

## Strategic Considerations

By carefully upgrading your modules, you can:

- **Enhance Mining Power:** Increase your land’s efficiency in extracting resources.
- **Improve Defenses:** Fortify your structures against alien threats.
- **Optimize Resource Extraction:** Maximize the yield and profitability of your operations.
