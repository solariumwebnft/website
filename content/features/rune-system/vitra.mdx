Vitra is the cryptocurrency linked to our game’s semi-decentralized blockchain, acting as the bridge between in-game achievements and real-world value. As a tradable asset, Vitra plays a pivotal role in the game’s economy, offering players the opportunity to convert their in-game efforts into tangible rewards.

### Core Features

- **Cryptocurrency Integration:**  
  Vitra represents the integration of blockchain technology within the game, allowing players to trade their mined Orbi for Vitra. This feature ensures that players' in-game efforts have real-world value, as Vitra can be exchanged on various cryptocurrency platforms.

- **Market Dynamics:**  
  The value of Vitra is influenced by the game's internal economy as well as broader cryptocurrency market trends. Players who accumulate Vitra can hold, trade, or reinvest it into the game to further enhance their mining operations and defenses.

- **Liquidity and Supply:**  
  At the game's launch, the initial estimated value of Vitra is set at **0.00002 BNB**, with a starting liquidity of **40 BNB** and a total supply of **2,000,000 Vitra tokens**. The maximum supply is capped at **20,000,000,000 tokens**, with a portion of this supply being generated through in-game activities such as mining and trade.

### Strategic Importance

- **Investment and Growth:**  
  Players can choose to reinvest their Vitra earnings back into the game by purchasing new modules, upgrades, and other assets, creating a feedback loop that enhances their in-game capabilities and potentially increases their Vitra holdings.

- **Cross-Platform Trading:**  
  Vitra's integration with external cryptocurrency markets allows players to trade their assets outside of the game environment. This feature adds an additional layer of strategy, as players must decide when to trade, hold, or reinvest their Vitra based on market conditions.

- **Economic Stability:**  
  To ensure the long-term stability of the in-game economy, Vitra's supply is carefully managed through mechanisms like token burning, halving events, and limited production caps on each planet. These features are designed to prevent inflation and maintain the value of both Orbi and Vitra within the game’s ecosystem.

## Conclusion

Vitra is the key to unlocking the full potential of the game's economy, providing players with the means to convert their in-game achievements into real-world value. Mastery of Vitra trading and management will be essential for players looking to maximize their success both in the game and in the broader cryptocurrency market.
