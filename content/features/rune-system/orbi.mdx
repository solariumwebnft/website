Orbi is the foundational in-game currency within our ecosystem, representing the valuable minerals mined from various planets in Solarium. It plays a critical role in the game's economic structure, serving as the primary resource for trade, upgrades, and player progression.

### Functionality and Role

- **Mining Resource:**  
  Orbi is the main resource extracted by players during their mining operations across different planets. Each player's mining efficiency and output are determined by the configuration and upgrades of their modules, with Orbi being the key output of these activities.
- **Trading and Commerce:**  
  Orbi can be traded within the game for **Stellar Hash (STLH)**, the internal game currency, allowing players to purchase **upgrades, modules**, and other in-game assets. The value of Orbi is closely tied to the supply and demand dynamics within the gameâ€™s economy.

- **Renewal Process:**  
  As part of the game's halving mechanism, when a planet reaches its maximum KHS (kilo-hashes per second) value, players must renew their modules using **anomalous materials from other planets**. Orbi serves as a key resource in this renewal process, making it essential for continued participation and success in the game.

- **Market Influence:**  
  The value of Orbi is directly influenced by player actions and market conditions within the game. Players who strategically manage their Orbi resources can gain significant advantages in the game's economic hierarchy.

### Interdependence and Strategy

- **Planetary Dependencies:**  
  Each planet in the game has an interdependent relationship with the others, where specific resources, including Orbi, are required from other planets to maintain and upgrade operations. For example, the red planet's resources may be essential for operations on the yellow planet, and vice versa. This system encourages **strategic trade** and collaboration among players.

- **Upgrades and Enhancements:**  
  Players can use Orbi to purchase and upgrade their **modules**, enhancing their mining capabilities, defense mechanisms, and overall efficiency. The ability to upgrade modules and sub-modules with Orbi provides players with the flexibility to adapt to changing game conditions and optimize their performance.

## Conclusion

Orbi is not just a resource; it is the lifeblood of the game's economy, driving player interactions, trade, and progression. Mastery of Orbi management will be key to success in the game.
