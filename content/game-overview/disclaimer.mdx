The value of these assets may fluctuate based on market conditions, player actions, and other factors. Players and investors should only participate with funds they can afford to lose.

- **Market Volatility:** The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and the value of Vitra and other in-game assets may be subject to significant changes. The game developers cannot guarantee any specific return on investment or asset value stability.

- **Technology Risk:** As a blockchain-based game, the platform relies on advanced technologies that may be subject to bugs, security breaches, or other unforeseen issues. While all reasonable measures are taken to secure the platform, there is always a risk of technological failures that could impact gameplay or asset security.

#### Legal Considerations

- **Regulatory Compliance:** The game and its associated tokens (Vitra, Orbi, Stellar Hash) are subject to the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions. It is the responsibility of players and investors to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations, including those related to cryptocurrency transactions and digital asset ownership.

- **No Guarantees:** The game developers make no guarantees regarding the performance, availability, or future development of the game. All features, content, and mechanics are subject to change at the discretion of the development team, and players should participate with an understanding of these uncertainties.

- **Intellectual Property:** All content, including game mechanics, graphics, and code, is the intellectual property of the game developers. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of this content is prohibited and may result in legal action.

#### Limitation of Liability

- **No Liability for Losses:** The game developers and associated parties are not liable for any losses incurred as a result of participating in the game, including but not limited to financial losses, data loss, or damage to digital assets. Participation is entirely at the player's and investor's own risk.

- **Third-Party Services:** The game may integrate with third-party services, including cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets. The developers are not responsible for the performance, security, or reliability of these third-party services.
