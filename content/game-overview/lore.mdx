## Context

In the 23rd century, humanity faced an existential crisis after a catastrophic incident involving advanced artificial intelligence. Forced to abandon Earth, survivors established space colonies as sanctuaries. As natural resources on Earth dwindled, the **Intergalactic Mining Alliance (IMA)** was formed to coordinate mining operations across distant planets, securing the future of humanity.

## Storyline

### **Phase One - Mining**

As members of an elite team of miners contracted by the IMA, players are tasked with exploring a set of uncharted solar systems known as **Solarium**. Rich in rare and valuable minerals, Solarium becomes the prime focus of humanity's mining efforts. Initially, the mission seems straightforward as players venture through planets, moons, and asteroids, overcoming natural challenges like extreme atmospheric conditions and treacherous terrains. However, as they delve deeper, players discover clues and signs of an unknown alien presence in Solarium.

### **Phase Two - Defense**

The peace is shattered by the emergence of the **A'tharis**, a mysterious alien race with conflicting interests in Solarium. Once peaceful, the A'tharis have become aggressive and distrustful following a devastating event on their home planet. As tensions rise, players must bolster their defenses and fortify their structures to withstand potential attacks. Forming alliances with other human factions in Solarium becomes crucial as everyone strives to protect their mining operations from this new threat.

### **Phase Three - Combat**

Tensions culminate in all-out war with the A'tharis. Players are thrust into epic battles to determine the fate of Solarium, deploying all their skills, alliances, and resources in combat. The outcome of this conflict will shape the future relationship between humanity and the A'tharis. Victorious players might secure a peaceful coexistence or dominate the A'tharis, while failure could lead to losing Solarium or even the total annihilation of the mining environment.
