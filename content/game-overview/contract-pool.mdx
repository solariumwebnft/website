### Contract Pool

The Contract Pool is a critical component of our game's blockchain infrastructure, ensuring the secure and transparent execution of transactions, ownership transfers, and various in-game activities. It is through these smart contracts that the game achieves its decentralized nature, providing players with true ownership and control over their digital assets.

#### Smart Contract Overview

- **Ownership and Transfer:** Smart contracts manage the ownership and transfer of in-game assets, including Orbi, Vitra, NFTs, and modules. These contracts ensure that all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable, giving players confidence in the integrity of the game’s economy.

- **Mining Operations:** The Contract Pool oversees the execution of mining activities, calculating rewards based on the player's mining power, module configurations, and planetary conditions. It ensures that the distribution of Orbi is fair and in line with the game's economic design.

- **Market Transactions:** The in-game market, where players trade Orbi for Stellar Hash (STLH) and other assets, is governed by smart contracts. These contracts handle pricing, transaction execution, and the transfer of assets between players, maintaining a balanced and fair marketplace.

- **Halving Events and Renewal:** Smart contracts manage the halving events that occur when a planet reaches its maximum KHS value. These events trigger the need for module renewal using anomalous materials from other planets, a process also governed by the Contract Pool. This system ensures that resource scarcity and renewal are handled transparently, maintaining the game's economic stability.

#### Security and Transparency

- **Immutable Ledger:** All transactions processed through the Contract Pool are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable ledger of ownership and activity. This transparency is essential for building trust among players and ensuring that the game’s economy remains fair and equitable.

- **Automated Execution:** The automation of transactions and operations via smart contracts eliminates the risk of human error or manipulation, ensuring that all players are subject to the same rules and conditions. This level of automation is critical for maintaining the integrity of the decentralized game environment.

- **Governance and Updates:** The Contract Pool is designed to be adaptable, allowing for governance by the community. Future updates to smart contracts can be proposed and voted on by players, ensuring that the game evolves in a way that reflects the collective interests of its participants.

The Contract Pool is the backbone of our game’s decentralized infrastructure, providing the security, transparency, and fairness necessary for a thriving player-driven economy. It is through these smart contracts that we deliver on our promise of true player ownership and a fully decentralized gaming experience.
