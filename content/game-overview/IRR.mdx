The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a key metric representing the expected profitability of investments within the game. Our game’s economy is crafted to provide both players and investors with a sustainable and rewarding financial ecosystem.

### Investment Structure

- **Module and Upgrade Costs:**  
  Each module in the game has a base cost, with a **25% spread** over the previous module's value. Upgrades follow a similar pattern, with each upgrade costing **three times** the value of the previous one.

- **Return on Investment (ROI):**
  - **Module ROI:**  
    The daily return for each module begins at **0.3%**, with a **0.01% increase** for each additional module added to the player's land.
  - **Upgrade ROI:**  
    Upgrades provide a **30% return** on their value per hour, significantly boosting the profitability of well-upgraded modules.

### Token Valuation

- **Initial Token Value:**  
  The game's token is initially valued at **0.00002 BNB**, with a starting liquidity of **40 BNB** and a total supply of **2,000,000 tokens**.

- **Supply Dynamics:**  
  The maximum token supply is capped at **20,000,000,000 tokens**, with each planet capable of contributing up to **6,000,000,000 tokens** towards the production cap.

- **Investment Minimums:**  
  The initial minimum investment is set at **900 Stellar Hash (STLH)**, with each Orbis (the mined resource) valued at **30 STLH**.

### Halving Events and Renewal

- **Halving Events:**  
  When a planet reaches its maximum **KHS** (kilo-hashes per second) value, a halving event occurs. This event prevents the addition of new lands to that planet, encouraging players to renew their modules.

- **Renewal Process:**  
  Players must renew their modules using **anomalous materials** from other planets. The renewal cost is calculated based on **80%** of the user’s invested value, ensuring continued profitability and incentivizing ongoing investment.

## Strategic Financial Management

By strategically managing investments in modules and upgrades, players can optimize their returns and achieve a favorable IRR. This approach not only makes participation in the game engaging but also financially rewarding.
