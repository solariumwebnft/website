- **Alien Encounters:** Players will frequently encounter hostile alien species, particularly the A'tharis, as they explore the Solarium. These encounters require players to defend their operations, using both their defensive structures and combat tactics to survive.

- **Environmental Hazards:** The game’s universe is filled with natural hazards such as extreme weather, unstable terrain, and cosmic anomalies. Players must navigate these dangers while managing their resources and maintaining their mining operations.
