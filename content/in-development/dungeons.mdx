Dungeons are a key feature in the game, offering players some of the most challenging and rewarding experiences. Designed as high-risk, high-reward environments, dungeons require careful planning, strategic combat, and a deep understanding of the game’s mechanics.

#### Core Features

- **Challenging Environments:** Dungeons are filled with difficult enemies, environmental hazards, and complex puzzles. Players must use their wits and resources to navigate these challenges and reach the rewards that lie within.

- **Stellarian Material:** One of the most valuable resources that can be found in dungeons is Stellarian, an anomalous material with powerful properties. Stellarian is crucial for boosting the specs of modules and upgrades temporarily or even permanently altering them.

- **Limited Resources:** Dungeons are designed to test the limits of a player’s resources and strategy. Players must carefully manage their energy, supplies, and combat capabilities to survive the dangers within and emerge victorious.

#### Strategic Importance

- **Resource Scarcity:** Stellarian and other dungeon-exclusive resources are rare and highly sought after. Players who successfully complete dungeons can gain significant advantages by using these materials to enhance their operations and defenses.

- **Boosting and Altering Modules:** Stellarian can be used in a variety of ways, including providing temporary boosts to module specs or making permanent changes to upgrade capabilities. This makes dungeons a vital part of the game’s long-term strategy and progression.

- **High-Risk, High-Reward:** The risks associated with dungeons are substantial, but so are the rewards. Players must weigh the potential gains against the dangers they face, making strategic decisions that can greatly impact their success in the game.

#### Ongoing Development

- **Evolving Challenges:** The dungeon system is continually being expanded, with new dungeons, enemies, and puzzles being added. Future updates will introduce even more complex environments and rare resources, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.

Dungeons represent the pinnacle of challenge in the game, offering the most daring players the chance to achieve great rewards through skill, strategy, and perseverance.
